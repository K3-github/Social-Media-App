- Like and Comment: Users can like and comment on posts, fostering an interactive and engaging environment.
- Profile Management: Users can view and update their profiles, see their followers and following, and search for other users.
- UI Design: The website is designed using HTML, CSS, and React to create an attractive and user-friendly interface.

### Technologies Used: 

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user data and posts.
- Express.js: A back-end web application framework for Node.js, used to handle HTTP requests and create the server.
- Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime used for back-end development and managing dependencies.
- React.js: A front-end JavaScript library for building the user interface and implementing features like hooks, useEffect, useState, and useRef.
- HTML and CSS: Used for designing and styling the website's user interface.
- Axios: Utilized to make HTTP requests to the backend server for fetching and sending data.
- Postman API: Used for testing HTTP requests during development.

### Challenges Faced: 

- User Authentication: Implementing secure login and user authentication using the Context API to manage user sessions effectively.
- Database Management: Ensuring smooth data handling and integration with MongoDB for user profiles and post storage.
- HTTP Requests: Managing HTTP requests using Axios and Postman API to fetch and post data between the front-end and back-end.
